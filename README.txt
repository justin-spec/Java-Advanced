These are all the assignments for Advanced Java. (using JavaSE-11)
It is organized into two folders: homework and classwork

classwork packages are organized as the following:
week(number)(day)_(assignment name)

Meanwhile homework is named by:
(number)_(assignment name)

This is assuming there is only homework once a week.


Each package will typically have a README unless it is not needed or the code is self explanitory.
