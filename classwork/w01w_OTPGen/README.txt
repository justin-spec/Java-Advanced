OTP Client

Assignment

	Take the current OTP generator code and enhance it to support the following:

    The user must be able to press a + button and add a sitename and press ok.
    Once the user does the above, a code is generated and the JFrame shows an entry for the site with a code and a refresh button next to it
    Instead of auto refresh per line, provide a button to manually generate a new code.
    Hint: Use Arraylist and Gridlayouts
    
How to use

	1. Enter company name in the text field
	2. Click the add button
	3. If desired, click the refresh button to generate a new OTP
